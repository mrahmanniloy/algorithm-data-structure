This repository holds some solutions to programming problems I have solved using Python 3.

Some solutions consist of 4 files for stress testing. In those case, just run the 'script.py' file in the terminal.

For example, to run the stress testing for fibonacci number just type "python3 script.py >input number<" in the command prompt and execute.
